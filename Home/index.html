            Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can
            reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data
            whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze.
            <br><br>
            AI is a broad field that encompasses many different disciplines, including computer science, data analytics
            and statistics, hardware and software engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, and even philosophy and
            psychology.
            <br><br>
            On an operational level for business use, AI is a set of technologies that are based primarily on machine
            learning and deep learning, used for data analytics, predictions and forecasting, object categorization,
            natural language processing, recommendations, intelligent data retrieval, and more

            <br>
            1943: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts propose the first mathematical model for neural networks.
            1950: Alan Turing introduces the Turing Test to evaluate machine intelligence.
            1956: The term "Artificial Intelligence" is coined at the Dartmouth Conference by John McCarthy, Marvin
            Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon.
            Formative Years (1960s-1970s)
            <br><br>
            1960s: Development of early AI programs like ELIZA, a pioneering natural language processing system.
            1966-1974: The first "AI Winter" occurs due to limited computational power and unmet expectations.
            Expert Systems and Renewed Interest (1980s)
            <br><br>
            1980s: Success of expert systems in industries such as medicine and finance revitalizes AI research.
            1986: Geoffrey Hinton and colleagues' work on backpropagation renews interest in neural networks.
            Machine Learning and Big Data (1990s-2000s)
            <br><br>
            1997: IBM's Deep Blue defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov.
            Late 1990s-2000s: The rise of the internet and big data propels AI advancements, particularly in machine
            learning.
            Deep Learning and Modern AI (2010s-Present)
