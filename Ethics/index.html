        <h1>Confronting the Critical Ethical Challenges of AI</h1>
        <br>
        <h6>AI poses several ethical challenges. Bias in AI systems can lead to unfair and discriminatory outcomes. Privacy is at risk due to extensive data collection and analysis capabilities. The lack of transparency in AI decision-making processes raises trust issues. Automation and AI-driven technologies threaten job security. Accountability for AI actions is complex, especially in cases of harm or error. Additionally, AI systems are vulnerable to hacking and manipulation, posing security risks. Addressing these concerns is crucial for the ethical and responsible use of AI.</h6>
